## graphics
This is a custom graphics and physics library with the goal of learning how low-level graphics work and synthesizing that into as simple an engine as possible.
The graphics library works in the periodic loop with graphics objects being manipulated every loop. The user can scale, move, rotate, morph, or delete objects in their code.


## physics
The engine also includes a rudimentary physics engine that allows for collisons, impulses, and forces to be applied to graphically rendered objects. 
This allowed for interesting projects on projectile motion, plantery orbits, and more.
